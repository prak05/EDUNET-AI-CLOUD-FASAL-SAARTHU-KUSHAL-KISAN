# EDUNET-AI-CLOUD-FASAL-SAARTHU-KUSHAL-KISAN
Fasal Saarthi: Kushal Kisan is an AI-powered crop recommendation system. It uses IBM Watsonx.ai Studio &amp; AutoAI to analyze soil/environmental data (N, P, K, temp, humidity, pH, rainfall) for optimal crop suggestions. Our "crop companion" empowers farmers, fostering "skilled farmers" and maximizing agricultural yield.
üåæ Fasal Saarthi: Kushal Kisan - AI-Powered Crop Recommendation System
‚ú® Project Overview
Fasal Saarthi: Kushal Kisan is an intelligent crop recommendation system designed to empower farmers and maximize agricultural yield through data-driven insights. Acting as a "Crop Companion" (Fasal Saarthi), it guides farmers with accurate recommendations to foster "Skilled Farmers" (Kushal Kisan) for sustainable and productive agriculture.

üí° Key Features
Intelligent Crop Recommendations: Provides data-backed suggestions for the most suitable crops.

Comprehensive Parameter Analysis: Utilizes soil nutrients (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall data.

Automated ML Pipeline: Built and deployed efficiently using IBM Watsonx.ai Studio's AutoAI.

High-Confidence Predictions: Delivers reliable crop suggestions.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools
IBM Cloud: Core cloud infrastructure.

IBM Watsonx.ai Studio: AI and data platform.

AutoAI: Automated machine learning service.

Python: Primary language for data processing and model interaction.

Java, JavaScript, Scala: Example client code for API interaction.

GitHub: For version control and project hosting.

üìä Dataset
The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset from the Indian Chamber of Food and Agriculture (ICFA), combining rainfall, climate, and fertilizer data for India.

Key Data Fields:

N: Nitrogen content ratio in soil

P: Phosphorous content ratio in soil

K: Potassium content ratio in soil

temperature: Temperature in Celsius

humidity: Relative humidity in %

ph: pH value of the soil

rainfall: Rainfall in mm

label: The recommended crop (target variable)
